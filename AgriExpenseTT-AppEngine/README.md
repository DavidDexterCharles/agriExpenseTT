AgriExpense - AppEngine Backend
===============================

Configuration Notes
-------------------
* Ensure that the eclipse installation only has the version that is supported by the project. The project is configured to use the default version of the google app engine plugin. If there are multiple version in the configuration it causes a problem building the project.

Development Notes
---------------------
* The UpAccEndpoint.java file is manually edited after the endpoint is generated. The manual edit includes the code that is needed to incorporate the namespace information into the application.
